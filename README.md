This repository contains my notes of Calculus and Statistics that I taught in the Department of Mathematics at The University of Texas at Tyler while I was appointed there as the Visiting Assistant Professor for my temporary tenure from Aug 2023-May2024. We have also provided exams that I conducted in my tenure as well!
